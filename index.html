<h1>the current situation of CAN BORNEO and basic information about orangutan</h1>
  <h2>1.With the increasing demand of palm oil around the world,especially in China,the people in CAN BORNEO cut down forests to plant the palm tree.So the habitat of the Orangutan has decreased a lot.
        So they have to eat the seedling of the palm tree,which is a disater to the farmers so they kill the Orangutan.Thus, the number of the Orangutan decreased rapidly.
<br>      2.The Orangutan has 97percent of DNA that is similar to human beings.They also have some behaviours that similar to humans such as swiming, using stick to get food, etc.
